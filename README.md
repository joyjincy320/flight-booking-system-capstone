## Solidity contract features
 - base ticketing contract functionality
 - The customer should be able to trigger a cancellation anytime till 2 hours before the flight start time. This should refund money to the customer minus the percentage penalty predefined in the contract by the airlines. The penalty amount should be automatically sent to the airline account.
 - Any cancellation triggered by the airline before or after departure time should result in a complete amount refund to the customer.
 - The airline should update the status of the flight within 24 hours of the flight start time. It can be on-time start, cancelled or delayed.
 - 24 hours after the flight departure time, the customer can trigger a claim function to demand a refund.
 - They should get a complete refund in case of cancellation by the airline. 
 - In case of a delay, they should get a predefined percentage amount, and the rest should be sent to the airline.
 - If the airline hasnâ€™t updated the status within 24 hours of the flight departure time, and a customer claim is made, it should be treated as an airline cancellation case by the contract.
 - Randomness and call based simulation of various features like normal flights, cancellation by the airline, cancellation by the customer, and delayed flights.
